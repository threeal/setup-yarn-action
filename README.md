The Setup Yarn Berry Action is a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) crafted for effortless installation of dependencies in a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) package utilizing the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.
Yarn is a fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool for Node.js projects, offering features such as deterministic dependency resolution and offline capabilities.

This action is designed to streamline GitHub workflows for Node.js projects, enabling quick and efficient installation by supporting the caching of dependencies. Whether you're working on a small project or a complex application, the Setup Yarn Berry Action ensures a smooth and accelerated dependency setup for your Node.js packages.

## Key Features

The Setup Yarn Berry Action provides the following key features:

- Install dependencies for a Node.js package using Yarn.
- Automatic Yarn enablement using [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) before installation.
- Support for caching dependencies installation, enhancing workflow speed.

## Usage

To begin using the Setup Yarn Berry Action, refer to the [action.yaml](./action.yaml) file for detailed configuration options.
If you are new to GitHub Actions, you can explore the [GitHub Actions guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) for a comprehensive overview.

| `cache` | `true` or `false` | `true`  | Indicates whether to use caching during Yarn installation. |

### Example

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to utilize the Setup Yarn Berry Action to install dependencies for a Node.js package using Yarn in your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Build
on:
  push:
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build Package
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.1
