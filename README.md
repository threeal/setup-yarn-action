The Yarn Install Action is a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) crafted for effortless installation of dependencies in a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) package utilizing the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.
Yarn is a fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool for Node.js projects, offering features such as deterministic dependency resolution and offline capabilities.

This action is designed to streamline GitHub workflows for Node.js projects, enabling quick and efficient installation by supporting the caching of dependencies. Whether you're working on a small project or a complex application, the Yarn Install Action ensures a smooth and accelerated dependency setup for your Node.js packages.

## Key Features

The Yarn Install Action provides the following key features:

- Install dependencies for a Node.js package using Yarn.
